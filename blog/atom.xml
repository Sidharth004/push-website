<p>We are happy to be sponsoring the ETHGlobal Istanbul hackathon with $10k bounties across 4 different prizes for a total of 13 winners.</p>
<p>Each prize is different with regards to both the type of Push Communication tools you need to build with, as well as the type of dApp you‚Äôre building.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="1--merhaba-push-protocol--1500">1. üèÜ Merhaba Push Protocol ‚∏∫ $1,500<a href="https://push.org/blog/push-ethglobal-istanbul#1--merhaba-push-protocol--1500" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. üèÜ Merhaba Push Protocol ‚∏∫ $1,500" title="Direct link to 1. üèÜ Merhaba Push Protocol ‚∏∫ $1,500">‚Äã</a></h4>
<p>We started with ‚ÄúGM GM!‚Äù and we‚Äôre here with ‚ÄúMerhaba!‚Äù.</p>
<p>This bounty is dedicated to the best use of Push Protocol in social-based dApps. It's about leveraging Push Notifications for important alerts and/or using our all-new <a href="https://push.org/blog/introducing-notification-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notification Settings</a> to customize notifications. We also want to highlight the potential integration of conditional gating (messaging that can only be accessible by holding a specific NFT, token, or activity history).</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas</p>
<ul>
<li><b>SocialImpactHub</b>: A DApp dedicated to social activists, where users can receive notifications about upcoming rallies or events.</li>
<li><b>EcoAlert</b>: An environmental initiative platform where users can chat about sustainable practices</li>
<li><b>CommunityCare</b>: A local community DApp where neighbors can communicate in real time, set up events, and receive notifications about local emergencies or activities.</li>
<li><b>PushForChange</b>: A fundraising platform that sends out notifications about new charitable campaigns. Users can chat with charity organizers and use conditional gating to access exclusive fundraising events based on their donation history.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Merhaba Push Protocol" seeks to acknowledge the innovative spirit of developers who merge social initiatives with technology, making a meaningful impact in the world using Push Protocol.</p>

<p>We are extremely excited to be releasing a long-awaited feature - Notification Settings!</p>
<p>This new feature enables both channels and users to customize the type of notifications they send and receive respectively.</p>
<p>Whether it's specifying which categories of articles on Coindesk you want to receive notifications for or setting alerts for when the price of ETH passes $2,000 ‚Äì a world of customization and personalization is now available for how you stay up-to-date in web3.</p>
<p>You can browse available channels to opt-in to here in the Push dApp üëâ<a href="https://app.push.org/channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://app.push.org/channels</a></p>
<p>In this article we‚Äôll explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why Notification Settings are important</li>
<li>How Notification Settings work for Channel Owners</li>
<li>What the UI/UX looks like for Channel Subscribers
Let‚Äôs dive in.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-notification-settings">Why Notification Settings?<a href="https://push.org/blog/introducing-notification-settings#why-notification-settings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Notification Settings?" title="Direct link to Why Notification Settings?">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Since the launch of v1 of Push smart contracts, we‚Äôve strived to leverage communication tools to help dApps deliver the most user-friendly and sticky user experience possible.</p>
<p>While we‚Äôve always given dApps the ability to create ‚Äòchannels‚Äô that users can subscribe to, segmenting different kinds of notifications for different users has always remained a challenge.</p>
<p>With Notification Settings, we‚Äôre now solving this long standing pain point to create an unparalleled level of customization and control for users. Channel Owners now have the ability to segment and categorize different notifications and Channel Subscribers now have the ability to select notifications that match their preferences.</p>
<p>Just as you might customize notifications through ‚ÄúAdvanced Notifications Settings‚Äù on your favorite web2 mobile apps, Notification Settings through Push brings a similar level of personalization to web3-native subscribers.</p>
<p>So, how do Notification Settings work for both Channel Owners and Channel Subscribers? We‚Äôll walk you through everything there is to know.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="notification-settings-for-channel-owners">Notification Settings for Channel Owners<a href="https://push.org/blog/introducing-notification-settings#notification-settings-for-channel-owners" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Notification Settings for Channel Owners" title="Direct link to Notification Settings for Channel Owners">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Push is a thriving community with hundreds of diverse channels spanning DeFi, gaming, web3 media, and beyond. These channels often have a wide range of content, notifications, and updates to share with their users.</p>
<p>For example, a DeFi channel might want to send various notifications like loan liquidation alerts, price alerts, or governance proposal notifications. Just as a newsletter might want to send notifications for new articles in its blog, but wouldn‚Äôt want to send every article to every subscriber.</p>
<p>With Notification Settings, Channel Owners can now define specific categories for their notifications. Consequently, when a channel triggers a notification for that specific category, only the users who've opted for that preference will receive a notification.</p>
<p>There are two types of channel settings for Channel Owners:</p>
<ol>
<li>True/False Notification Settings: The first channel setting lets you set up a channel with a simple true/false trigger setting. For instance, say your channel covers web3 news. You can define settings for categories of articles like  "tech" and ‚Äúpartnership announcements‚Äù and give users the option to turn each On (true) or Off (false). Adding one of these Notification Settings for every content category gives end-users the option to opt-in for content categories that match their preferences and avoid ones that don‚Äôt.</li>
<li>Range Value Notification Settings: The second channel setting lets you set up a range of values for a specific category that might trigger a notification. For instance, say you want to set up a Notification Setting that triggers when the price of ETH passes a given value. You can simply create a range, say from 0-10,000 and subscribers will be able to select any value within that range to set their custom ETH price notification.
You can set as many or as few Notification Settings for your channel as you like.
Here‚Äôs how it looks.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Introducing Notification Settings" src="https://push.org/assets/images/image-1-8ad26187a9265c58c87b6bc0fa7eda4c.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q">
</p><div class="SharedStyling__ImageText-sc-1enui31-27 cWgBCt"><b>Caption:</b> This channel has 5 Notification Settings. 4 of which are True/False Notification Settings and 1 of which is a Range Value Notification Setting. As such, end-users will have the choice to toggle on/off preferences for each of these 5 notifications separately.</div><p></p>
<p>Note, each channel will also set a ‚Äòdefault value‚Äô setting. This ensures subscribers who opt-in without specifying their preferences will simply receive notifications based on the channel's default settings.</p>
<p>For builders looking to integrate Notification Settings, you can find all the relevant and associated documentation here</p>
<p>üëâ <a href="https://push.org/docs/notifications/build/create-channel-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://push.org/docs/notifications/build/create-channel-settings/</a></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="notification-settings-for-channel-subscribers">Notification Settings for Channel Subscribers<a href="https://push.org/blog/introducing-notification-settings#notification-settings-for-channel-subscribers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Notification Settings for Channel Subscribers" title="Direct link to Notification Settings for Channel Subscribers">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Empowering Channel Subscribers (end-users) to personalize their notifications is a massive step towards a more user-centric and user-friendly web3 experience. Channel Subscribers can filter out notifications they aren't interested in receiving to reduce notification clutter. This optimizes user inboxes, reduces spam, and helps personalize the user experience.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how it works for Channel Subscribers:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you subscribe to a channel that has enabled Notification Settings, you‚Äôll have the option to personalize your notification preferences based on the available settings the Channel Owner has preset.
The choice to customize is optional. You can always opt-in for the ‚Äòdefault values‚Äô of a channel (these ‚Äòdefault value‚Äô notifications are determined by the Channel Owner).
Once you‚Äôve selected your preferences for all of the Notification Settings, you can click ‚Äòopt-in‚Äô to initiate the subscription and begin receiving notifications!
This is how the UI will prompt you to select your choice of notification for the channel:</li>
</ol>

</p><div class="SharedStyling__ImageText-sc-1enui31-27 cWgBCt"><b>Caption:</b> For this channel, there are 4 available Notification Settings to pick from. 3 settings correspond to simple on-off toggles and 1 corresponds to a range value. For this range value setting, you can set any value (price) that you want to receive notifications for within that range.</div><p></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You can review all the channels you are receiving notifications for and manage those settings directly within your ‚ÄúNotification Settings‚Äù tab. This dashboard gives you a complete birds-eye-view of all your notifications and lets you edit and change your settings any time at no cost.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notification Settings is a game-changer.</p>
<p>For Channel Owners that want to provide the best level of control and personalization for their users, Notification Settings mean being able to now categorize notifications and updates to only give users information they want.</p>
<p>For Channel Subscribers that want a personalized and engaging user experience, Notification Settings mean being able to accommodate their personal preferences.
At Push, we‚Äôre constantly reaffirming our commitment to decentralizing communication and onboarding the next one billion users to web3. As such, we‚Äôre looking to build upon Notification Settings and release more communication personalization features soon.</p>
<p>Stay tuned because the best is yet to come.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of Maximizing Network Resilience" src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-4191cfac151b065e5e65b6263fa098b7.webp" width="1400" height="735" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In communication networks, liveness signifies the network‚Äôs ability to maintain operations and remain responsive to incoming traffic. Because traditional communication networks possess central points of failure, the entire network is at risk of collapse. This can lead to numerous issues, including disruptions to essential services and communication channels. For example, an outage by a primary IT provider could render an entire network unusable for an extended period.</p>
<p>In contrast, distributed and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks present an alternative model of liveness. These networks rely on nodes to operate effectively, eliminating a single point of failure that could compromise the entire system. This design makes distributed networks highly resilient in the face of significant disruptions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, liveness can still pose challenges even within distributed and P2P networks. If nodes fail or go offline, communication channels might be disrupted, despite the entire network remaining operational. This is where Push protocol comes into play.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="unmatched-liveness-and-resilience">Unmatched Liveness and Resilience<a href="https://push.org/blog/maximize-network-resilience-the-advantage-of-push-protocol#unmatched-liveness-and-resilience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Unmatched Liveness and Resilience" title="Direct link to Unmatched Liveness and Resilience">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Push Protocol ensures uninterrupted and resilient communication, even in the face of disruptions. With its distributed and peer-to-peer (P2P) principles, the network remains operational and highly resilient, eliminating the risk of a single point of failure. Redundant nodes, intelligent routing algorithms, and failover mechanisms guarantee liveness, making Push Protocol highly reliable and resilient against disruptions.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="liveness-and-unstoppable-communication">Liveness and Unstoppable Communication<a href="https://push.org/blog/maximize-network-resilience-the-advantage-of-push-protocol#liveness-and-unstoppable-communication" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Liveness and Unstoppable Communication" title="Direct link to Liveness and Unstoppable Communication">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Unlike traditional communication networks that are susceptible to disruptions and censorship, Push Protocol enables unstoppable communication. Nodes can directly communicate with each other without relying on centralized intermediaries. Communication channels established with Push Protocol are sovereign network constructs, ensuring their continued operation and allowing users to stay connected and informed, irrespective of external challenges.</p>

<p>In light of the additional context provided, let‚Äôs dive deeper into how Push Protocol compares to other decentralized communication methods, keeping the unique features and characteristics of Push Protocol in mind.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="push-protocol-as-p2p-communication">Push Protocol as P2P Communication<a href="https://push.org/blog/breaking-down-and-comparing-different-decentralized-communication-technologies#push-protocol-as-p2p-communication" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Push Protocol as P2P Communication" title="Direct link to Push Protocol as P2P Communication">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>While Push Protocol is a form of P2P communication, it expands upon traditional P2P communication by integrating blockchain technology, smart contract interactions, and wallet-to-wallet communication. This combination allows Push Protocol to offer a more secure, decentralized, and user-centric communication experience tailored to the needs of the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Channels and Opt-in</b>: Push Protocol enables communication channels,
which allow wallet addresses to opt in or subscribe to receive notifications.
This user-centric approach ensures that users only receive notifications they
are interested in, minimizing spam and unwanted messages.</li>
<li><b>Decentralized Network of Push Nodes</b>: Push Protocol is maintained by a
decentralized network of Push Nodes, each having a specific role in validating
and delivering messages between wallet addresses. This architecture provides a
higher degree of redundancy and resiliency than traditional P2P networks.</li>
<li><b>Encryption and Verification Proof</b>: Push Protocol uses PGP encryption to
secure messages and provides a Verification Proof mechanism for validating the
sender, the chain, and the content of messages. This ensures data integrity
and privacy, which may be lacking in traditional P2P communication systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="push-protocol-and-blockchain-based-messaging">Push Protocol and Blockchain-based Messaging<a href="https://push.org/blog/breaking-down-and-comparing-different-decentralized-communication-technologies#push-protocol-and-blockchain-based-messaging" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Push Protocol and Blockchain-based Messaging" title="Direct link to Push Protocol and Blockchain-based Messaging">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>While Push Protocol utilizes blockchain communication, it incorporates blockchain-based messaging elements, such as user addresses and cryptography for secure communication. However, Push Protocol goes beyond essential blockchain communication by supporting any network, not just blockchain and web3, enabling more extensive interoperability and flexibility.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Native Integration with Wallet Addresses</b>: Push Protocol enables
communication between wallet addresses without needing personal information.
This contrasts with some blockchain-based messaging systems that require
additional information or rely on smart contract-based user management.</li>
<li><b>IPFS-based Storage</b>: Messages in Push Protocol are stored on IPFS,
ensuring decentralized and tamper-proof storage, while some blockchain-based
messaging systems store messages directly on the blockchain, which can be less
efficient and more costly.</li>
<li><b>Spam Prevention</b>: Push Protocol focuses on spam prevention through
opt-in channels, chat requests, and inbox/request separation. In contrast,
some blockchain-based messaging systems might not have built-in spam
prevention mechanisms or rely solely on transaction fees to deter spam.</li>
</ul>
